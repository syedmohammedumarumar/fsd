# 📘 Lab Manual: Basic Linux/Unix and Git Commands

## **🎯 Aim**

To practice and understand essential Linux/Unix terminal commands including file operations, navigation, and Git/GitHub commands for version control.

---

## **📝 Procedure**

1. Open your Linux terminal or command line interface.
2. Try each command listed below in sequence.
3. Observe the behavior/output of each command.
4. Take notes on what each command does and where it can be used in real-world tasks.
5. Use GitHub to push code changes and practice version control.

## **✅ Expected Results**

By the end of this lab, students should be able to:

* Navigate directories and files in Linux/Unix.
* Create, delete, move, and modify files.
* Use Git for version control.
* Commit, push, and pull code from a GitHub repository.
